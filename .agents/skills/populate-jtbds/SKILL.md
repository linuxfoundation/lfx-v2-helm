Populate `@fgadoc:jtbd` annotations in
`charts/lfx-platform/templates/openfga/model.yaml` by reading live API
authorization rules from the dev cluster and synthesizing them into
short, action-oriented Job-to-Be-Done (JTBD) statements.

Run this skill whenever the OpenFGA model gains new types or relations and
the JTBD annotations need to be refreshed from real API usage.

## Gotchas

- `RuleSet` is a Heimdall CRD with API group `heimdall.dadrus.github.com`.
  Use the short resource name `rulesets` — the full resource name is
  `rulesets.heimdall.dadrus.github.com`.
- `[user:*]` in a define expression means "every user including anonymous"
  — it is **not** a `[user]` direct grant and must not generate a JTBD.
- Do not modify lines that are not `@fgadoc:jtbd` — `@fgadoc:alias` and
  `@fgadoc:hide` must be left exactly as they are.

## Discipline rules — read before synthesizing any JTBD

These rules are non-negotiable. Violating them produces fabricated JTBDs
that mislead users about what a role can actually do.

**1. Strict group isolation.** Every JTBD must be grounded in a route that
appears in that exact `object#relation` group in the extracted data. A route
that belongs to a *different* relation — even on the same object type — does
**not** count. Do not infer or borrow across groups.

**2. Use the `description` field, not `summary` or the path pattern.**
The OpenAPI `description` field is the source of truth for what an endpoint
does. The `summary` is often a terse label and the path pattern can be
misleading. If a route has no `description`, fall back to `summary`, and flag
it for manual review.

**3. No RuleSet checks → no JTBD.** If a relation has no routes in the
extracted groups (i.e. it is not present in `/tmp/openfga_groups.json`), leave
it with zero `@fgadoc:jtbd` lines. Do not invent plausible-sounding statements.

**4. Do not generalize write verbs.** Only use `Create & manage` or
`Update & delete` if *both* a creation route (POST) **and** an
update/delete route (PUT/PATCH/DELETE) are present in that exact group.
A single POST does not justify "manage"; a single PUT does not justify "create".

## Step 1 — List all RuleSets on the dev cluster

```bash
kubectl get rulesets --all-namespaces -o json > /tmp/rulesets.json
```

## Step 2 — Extract OpenFGA checks

Parse `/tmp/rulesets.json`. For each rule whose `authorizer` contains an
`openfga_check` entry, collect:

- `ruleset` — `metadata.name` of the RuleSet (best approximation of the owning repo/service name)
- `method` — HTTP method (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE, …)
- `route` — URL path pattern (e.g. `/committees`)
- `object` — OpenFGA object type (e.g. `project`)
- `relation` — OpenFGA relation required (e.g. `writer`)

Group the results by `<object>#<relation>` (e.g. `project#writer`).

Typical RuleSet shape (abbreviated):

```json
{
  "metadata": { "name": "lfx-v2-committee-service" },
  "spec": {
    "rules": [
      {
        "match": {
          "methods": ["POST"],
          "routes": [{ "path": "/committees" }]
        },
        "execute": [
          {
            "authorizer": "openfga_check",
            "config": {
              "values": { "object": "project:...", "relation": "writer" }
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Step 3 — Fetch OpenAPI specs for each service

For each RuleSet from step 2, scan its rules for a route whose path ends in
`openapi3.yaml`. This path is the canonical OpenAPI spec endpoint for that
service — served publicly at `https://lfx-api.dev.v2.cluster.linuxfound.info/`.

**Attempt 1 — live endpoint:**

```
GET https://lfx-api.dev.v2.cluster.linuxfound.info<openapi3.yaml path>
```

Example: if the RuleSet contains `/_committees/openapi3.yaml`, fetch
`https://lfx-api.dev.v2.cluster.linuxfound.info/_committees/openapi3.yaml`.

**Attempt 2 — GitHub fallback (if the live fetch fails or returns non-200):**

Search the `linuxfoundation` GitHub organization for `openapi3.yaml` in any
repo matching `lfx-v2-*`, using `metadata.name` of the RuleSet as the best
approximation of the repo name:

```
filename:openapi3.yaml repo:linuxfoundation/<ruleset-metadata-name>
```

Use the GitHub code search tool or API to locate the file, then read its
contents directly from the repo.

For each `method + route` pair from step 2, match it against the
OpenAPI `paths` object and extract the `description` field. If no
`description` is present, fall back to `summary`. Do not use the path
pattern itself as a description source.

## Step 4 — Synthesize JTBD statements

For each `<object>#<relation>` group you now have a set of API operation
descriptions. Read `references/jtbd-examples.txt` for style guidance, then
synthesize each group into one or more short, action-oriented JTBD statements.

**JTBD style rules:**
- Start with an imperative verb: *View*, *Create*, *Manage*, *Update*,
  *Add*, *Delete*, *Deploy*, *Cast*, *Submit*…
- One line, 10 words or fewer.
- Scope to what a person *wants to accomplish*, not the technical action.
- Use `&` instead of `and`.
- Do **not** use user-story format.

## Step 5 — Propose changes before writing

Before editing `model.yaml`, print a summary table of the proposed changes:

```
object#relation         | proposed JTBDs
------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------
project#writer          | Update project metadata; Manage project artifacts
meeting#organizer       | Create & manage project meetings & participants
...
```

For any relation where no OpenAPI description was found, flag it:

```
⚠  meeting#auditor — no OpenAPI description found; skipping (manual review needed)
```

Ask for confirmation before proceeding. If running non-interactively, proceed
automatically but include the summary in the final report.

## Step 6 — Write `@fgadoc:jtbd` macros into model.yaml

For each confirmed `<object>#<relation>` group:

1. Find the `define <relation>:` line within the correct `type` block.
2. **Replace** only the `# @fgadoc:jtbd` lines in the comment block
   immediately above that `define`. Leave all other lines untouched.
3. The comment format must be:

```yaml
            # @fgadoc:jtbd <statement one>
            # @fgadoc:jtbd <statement two>
            define <relation>: ...
```

Leave unchanged any `define` lines not covered by a RuleSet rule.

## Step 7 — Verify

Re-read `model.yaml` and confirm:

- Count of `@fgadoc:jtbd` lines has changed only for the affected relations.
- No `@fgadoc:alias` or `@fgadoc:hide` lines were removed or altered.
- `git diff --name-only` shows only `model.yaml` changed.

If any of these checks fail, revert and report the issue.

## Output

Report:
- How many `<object>#<relation>` groups were processed.
- How many JTBD statements were written.
- Any relations flagged for manual review (no OpenAPI description found).
